You're building an activity feed for a social media site. The feed must
 display a chronological list of activities for the current user's friends.
 These activities could potentially be any action performed on the site
 including uploading a photo, changing their profile, friending another user,
 commenting, liking etc... Further, you only want to display activities for
 users that the current user interacts with frequently.


 {
   "Users": {
     "George": {
       "Friends": [
         {"id": 42343242,
           "recentInteractions": 155
         },
         {"id": 42343242,
           "recentInteractions": 121
         },
         {"id": 42343242,
           "recentInteractions": 77
           }
         ],
       "feedActivity": [42324343, 543532324, 654654543, 654643342, 65345354],
     }
   }
 }

 Events are generated an id.
 If user has the friend who created the event IN their top 10 spots, they will
 recieve the event ID into their feedActivity.

 When user interacts with a friend, the friend's recentInteractions is incremented.
